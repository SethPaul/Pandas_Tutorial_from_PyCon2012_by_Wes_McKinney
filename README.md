These notebooks are built from Wes McKinney's 2012 PyCon ["Data analysis in Python with pandas presentation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26x-z-BdWQ)

The video is very informative. These allow a quick scan of what was covered. If you choose to watch the video, things are slow going until about 28:16.

Some of the Ipython/Jupyter is a litle dated. Some added fucntionality has been added to pandas since this talk but very little from the talk is not relevent still today. There are a few commands that have changed but it will warn of depracation and suggest the new command or format.

The data files used are:

* baby-names2.csv: name proportions in teh US from 1880-2008
* births.csv: number of births in the US for teh same year range

* stock.csv: stocks for AA,AAPL,GE,IBM,JNJ,MSFT,PEP,SPX,XOM for 2007-10-29 to 2011-10-14

* P00000001-ALL.txt: 2012 election contributions


The suggested flow derived from the presentation is pandas data structures > stocks > baby names > election data.
